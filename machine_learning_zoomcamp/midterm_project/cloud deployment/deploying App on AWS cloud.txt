ECR
----------
* Create a repository on ECR to store the docker image: aws ecr create-repository --repository-name INSERT-NAME-OF-IMAGE
* Copy the "repositoryUri": this is the url of the repository
* Log in to the repository (to be able to push the docker image): aws ecr get-login --no-include-email
	* you can immediately execute the command by adding ${}: ${aws ecr get-login --no-include-email}
* Reformat the repositoryUri as such - adding the TAG to the docker image you want to push:
	ACCOUNT=366009647617
	REGION=us-east-1
	REGISTRY=zoomcamp_midterm_project
	PREFIX=${ACCOUNT}.dkr.ecr.${REGION}.amazonaws.com/${REGISTRY}
	TAG=zoomcamp_midterm_project
	REMOTE_URI=${PREFIX}:${TAG}

* Tag the docker image with the REMOTE Uri created above: docker tag zoomcamp_midterm_project_cloud:latest ${REMOTE_URI}
* Push the docker image to the ECR repository: docker push ${REMOTE_URI}
